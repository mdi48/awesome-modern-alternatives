# awesome-new-and-improved [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
An awesome list of modern tools that improve upon older ones (NOT just written in Rust. Language choice alone is not considered an improvement.)

I should also mention that:
1. This list will often be opinionated
2. Only add stuff that I or anyone who wishes to collaborate with me have experience with
3. For the most part I will only give the "highly recommended" label to stuff I consider absolutely essential
4. This does not mean older tools are bad or irrelevant. There are many times when older tools still have their usage and the existence 
of stuff that is easier to use does not mean we should ditch old things entirely.
